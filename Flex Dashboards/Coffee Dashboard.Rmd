**About the Project**
<br>
<br>
This project is completely made up and looks to examine whether coffee consumed has any bearing on words written per day in PhD students. <br>
Hopefully by the end of this you get an idea of what flexdashboards can do and whether you need more coffee.
<br>
Here is a picture that is embedded in the document. This guy makes a great coffee

## Column

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("Cafe.jpg")
```




# Data

## Column

Lets have a look at the data visually. To do this we can embed a couple of plots and a filter for our data

```{r}

filter_select(id = "Student",
    label = "Select a Student",
    sharedData = Coffee,
    group = ~`Student`,
    multiple = T)

```


The filter has some downsides compared to Shiny. When you open the html file everything is displayed and there is no option for a default. The All function doesn't function either so you can make select multiple available. <br>

Other options if you don't love this is to just use the interactivity of the plotly object.<br>

On this page we also have a tab structure so you can flick through different plots.
<br>
You can also make a filter that is a slider

```{r}

filter_slider(id = "Day",
              label = "Day of the Month",
              sharedData = Coffee,
              column = ~`Day`,
              step = 1)

```

Note that the slider obliterates the boxplot because it doesn't have an element that depends on "Day"

## Column {.tabset}

### Coffee vs Time
```{r}

CoffeeTime.Plot = Coffee %>% ggplot(aes(x = Day, y = Coffee, colour = Student, group = Student))+
                          geom_point()+
                          geom_line()+
                          theme_light()+
                          labs(x = "Day of Month", y = "Coffees Consumed")

ggplotly(CoffeeTime.Plot)

```

### Words vs Time
```{r}

WordTime.Plot = Coffee %>% ggplot(aes(x = Day, y = Words, colour = Student, group = Student))+
                          geom_point()+
                          geom_line()+
                          theme_light()+
                          labs(x = "Day of Month", y = "Words Written")

ggplotly(WordTime.Plot)

```


### Words
```{r}

Word.Plot = Coffee %>% ggplot(aes(x = Student, y = Words, fill = Student, group = Student))+
                          geom_boxplot()+
                          theme_light()+
                          labs(x = "Student", y = "Words Written")

ggplotly(Word.Plot)

```



# Results

## Column

To answer this question we might want to fit a mixed model to our data. <br>
Using lme4 we fit this model


```{r echo = T}

Model = lmer(Words ~ Coffee + (1+Coffee|Student), data = Data)
```

<br>
We can output some model information directly into the dashboard
<br>

```{r echo=T}
summary(Model)$coefficients
coefficients(Model)

```


## Column

We might also like to make a plot of our model

``` {r, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 6, fig.align = 'center'}


# Extract fixed effects

FE = summary(Model)$coefficients
LinData = data.frame("Coffee" = c(0:5))
LinData$Wmean = FE[1,1] + LinData$Coffee*FE[2,1]
LinData$Wup = (FE[1,1]+FE[1,2]) + LinData$Coffee*(FE[2,1]+FE[2,2])
LinData$Wlo = (FE[1,1]-FE[1,2]) + LinData$Coffee*(FE[2,1]-FE[2,2])


# Create the plot
ggplot(Data, aes(x = Coffee)) +
 geom_point(data = Data, aes(color = factor(Student), y = Words), alpha = 0.6) + # Scatter plot of data points
 geom_smooth(data = Data, aes(colour = Student, group = Student, y = Words), method = 'lm')+
 geom_ribbon(data = LinData, aes(x = Coffee, ymin = Wlo, ymax = Wup), alpha = 0.3, fill = "blue")+
 geom_line(data = LinData, aes(x = Coffee, y = Wmean), colour = "blue")+
 labs(title = "Effect of Coffee Consumption on Words Written",
 x = "Coffee Consumption (cups)",
 y = "Words Written",
 color = "Student ID") +
 theme_light()

coefs = summary(Model)

```

As we can see there is a potential positive benefit for having more coffees when wanting to write more words. If in doubt **have more coffee.**
